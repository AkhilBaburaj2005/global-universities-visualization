# Geocoding and Mapping Project 🌍

A Python application that geocodes university locations using OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API and visualizes them on an interactive map.

## 📋 Project Description
This system processes university names from an input file (`where.data`), retrieves geographic coordinates via the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API, and stores results in a SQLite database. The data is then exported to a JavaScript file (`where.js`) and visualized using OpenStreetMap with OpenLayers.

### Key components:
- **`geoload.py`**: Batch processes locations with API rate limiting (1 request/sec).
- **`geodump.py`**: Exports geographic data to JavaScript format (`where.js`).
- **`where.html`**: Interactive map visualization interface.
- **`where.js`**: Contains geocoded university data.
- **`opengeo.sqlite`**: SQLite database for storing geodata.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Required modules: `sqlite3`, `urllib`, `json`, `ssl`
- DB Browser for SQLite (recommended)
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

## 🚀 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
```

## 💻 Usage

### Process Locations (Generates `opengeo.sqlite`):
```bash
python3 geoload.py
```
**Note:** Input file `where.data` required.

### Export Data (Creates `where.js`):
```bash
python3 geodump.py
```

### Visualize Results:
Open `where.html` in a web browser.

## 📊 Data Structure
The `where.js` file contains an array `myData` with the following structure for each entry:

```javascript
[latitude, longitude, 'University Name']
```

### Example:
```javascript
[50.065703299999996, 19.918958667058632, 'AGH University of Science and Technology']
```

## 📸 Required Screenshots
- Terminal output showing successful `geoload.py` execution.
- Database snapshot from DB Browser showing records.
- Map visualization with multiple location pins in `where.html`.
